# Contoso University
Microsoft Student Accelerator 2015 final project. Have a look at the result here! http://contoso-university-app.azurewebsites.net/ (but the API doesn't work unless you poke it in Swagger first..)

Hosted on Microsoft Azure, this project uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Swagger for an API framework. It also has a live SignalR chat!

## What is the Microsoft Student Accelerator programme?
It's a year long programme that teaches students skills that are relevant in the real-world tech industry. The focus changes every year, and in 2015 it focused on JavaScript, responsive designs like Bootstrap, and how to use APIs.

## Things I Learned
- ajax
- How to use APIs with Swagger
- Azure hosting
- SignalR
- Twitter Bootstrap
- How to connect up Facebook login, but it wasn't fully implemented before the deadline
